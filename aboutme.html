					<h2> Things I Enjoy </h2>
						<h5> The thing I enjoy most is probably video games. I play lots of games on PC with my friends and I enjoy learning about computers. Some games I play are R6 Siege, Overwatch, Fortnite,
								Fallout, and many other games. I also like to learn about computers and how they work, I also built my own computer. I've done a bit of coding before and I hope to study it in college.
